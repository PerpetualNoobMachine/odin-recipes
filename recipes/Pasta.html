<h1>Roasted Cherry Tomato Pasta</h1>
<p width="50">Roasting enhances the flavors of any vegetable, but seems to add a wonderful, 
    rich sweetness<br>when done with cherry tomatoes. This recipe takes that sweetness, 
    complements it with fresh<br> herbs and a touch of heat from red pepper flakes, with some low-fat 
    ricotta to smooth it all out.<br> I topped it with some salty, nutty Pecorino cheese.</p>
